[["index.html", "Movie Industry Analysis Chapter 1 Introduction", " Movie Industry Analysis Anna Dai, Victoria Edwards, Dashansh Prajapati 2021-12-13 Chapter 1 Introduction IMDb (Internet Movie Database) is an online database related to films, television series, home videos, video games, and streaming content online- including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews. IMDb began as a fan-operated movie database on the Usenet group rec.arts.movies in 1990, and moved to the web in 1993. It is now owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon. We chose to explore IMDb data because our groups common interest is film. With the IMDb data we explored different aspects of the film industry to see if we could find any interesting insights in the data. We were especially interested in exploring gender biases. We wanted to see if there was a drastic actor wage gap and lead actor age gap between genders. We also explored actor and actress ratings to see if there were any differences in overall ratings based on gender. We also explored movie run time over time to see if movies are getting longer or shorter, most popular movie genres, average ratings across different types of media and countries with the most movie releases. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our primary data source is IMDb (Internet Movie Database, https://datasets.imdbws.com) which is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon. Sources for the IMDb data include on-screen credits, press kits, official bios, autobiographies, and interviews. While data from this site is collected and verified by IMDb with studios and filmmakers, the bulk of the information is submitted by people in the industry and website visitors. The IMDb datasets we used for this project have a consistent data format which utilizes an alphanumeric unique identifier for the title of each film and an alphanumeric unique identifier for each name/person (director, actor etc.). Types of variables in the dataset include strings, arrays of strings, integers and booleans. The only issue we came across when using this dataset was the way missing values and unknown data were handled which we will further discuss in the missing values chapter. Since IMDb does not contain salary data and one the topics we were interested in exploring was the gender pay gap in the film industry, we incorporated salary data from Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2017/08/22/full-list-the-worlds-highest-paid-actors-and-actresses-2017/?sh=5b3efcbb3751). Unfortunately, we could not find a full dataset of actor/actress salary information without a paid subscription. Although this type of data gathering is not ideal, we decided to pivot around the restricted access to the film industrys salary data and copied the data from Forbes into a csv. Since this data was manually inputted, we assured it was in a format consistent to the IMDb data and all unique identifiers matched. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Most of our data transformation involved merging and filtering different IMDb datasets. For instance, to prepare our data for a Cleveland dot plot of top ranked actors/actresses and their respective salaries we first merged a dataset that consisted of actor/actress information with a dataset that contained title and rating data for each film. After this initial merge we were able to calculate an average rating for each actor/actress. We then created a new column that assigned each actor/actress a rank and grouped the top actor with the top actress in the Cleveland dot plot to visualize salary difference. Another interesting data transformation was done to create a graph of median age of lead actors/ actresses from 1920 to 2020. To get the data in the appropriate format we first needed to calculate the age of lead actors and actresses for all movies. We did this by merging a movie dataset with an actor/actress general information dataset to get the start year of each film and the birth year of each actor/actress. Once we had this information were able to graph the median age of actors and actresses over time to visualize any age bias between genders. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values As the first two plots indicate, there are only missing values (NA) in the primaryProfession column in the original data set. From the site,  is used by the creators to denote that a particular field is missing or null for that title/name and for the deathYear column if it is not applicable. Although we are unsure why the creators were not consistent with using  as their missing value indicator, we found  in columns birthYear, deathYear, and knownForTitle and NA in only the primaryProfession column.After further analysis we made a few adjustments in order to clarify what data is actually missing data versus what data is not applicable for the respective column. For instance, if both birthYear and deathYear are  for a given individual we can assume with some certainty that the birthday for that individual was not publicly available whereas if an individual has a birthYear provided and a  in the deathYear column, we can assume the individual is still alive and therefore deathYear is not applicable for that individual. To deal with this discrepancy we replaced all birthYear  with NA as they are true missing values and replaced deathYear  to NA if the respective birthYear is NA. With this modification it is now clear which individuals are missing birth information (true missing value) versus which individuals are still living (not applicable).

From this graph you can see that each of the five top rated actors have higher ratings than their female counterparts. 5.2 Comparison of Salary of Actors vs Actress This Cleveland dot plot shows the top 10 ranked actors and actresses (grouped) and their salaries for 2017. From this graph we can see that 8 out of the 10 top actors had a larger salary than their female counterparts. Also noticeable from this graph is the wage difference of over tens of millions of dollars in many groups where actors made more than actresses. In the two groups where actresses made more money than actors, the wage gap was less than ten million dollars. 5.3 Comparison of Salary of Actors vs Actress This dot plot shows the top paid actors and actresses and their respective salaries in 2017. We filtered this dataset by the 10 top ranked actors and actresses. From this graph we can see the top paid actor, Vin Diesel, made over 25 million dollars more than the top paid actress, Emma Stone. 5.4 Frequency of movie genres This graph shows the frequency of genres from the IMDb data. Drama and documentary are the leading genres with comedy as the third most frequent with less than half the value of drama and documentary. 5.5 Mosaic category and genre From this Mosaic graph, we can see that there is an association between the category (editor, producer, and writer) and genres (action, comedy, and drama) because the number of movies in each category of genres changes depending on the category of the movie professionals. 5.6 Percentage of Genres From 2010 to 2020 This line graph plots the percentage of genres over years from 2010 to 2020. While most genres remained relatively unchanged during this decade, drama and comedy had a steady decline and incline from 2010 to 2013, respectively. From 2017 to 2019 the reverse percent change. 5.7 Average Ratings Across Different Media This boxplot shows the average rating across different media types. To our surprise, movies have the lowest median for average ratings while TV episodes have the highest median. While the spread for all media content is large, videos have the largest spread of average ratings. 5.8 Median Age of Actors/Actress From 1925 to 2020 In this graph we plotted the median age of lead actors and actresses from 1920 to 2021. Although the wage gap varies from year to year, the median age of lead actors is almost a decade older than that of actresses throughout all years. Also noticeable from this graph is the slight overall decrease in the wage gap from about 1990 onwards. 5.9 Average Movie Run Time in Minutes From 1920 to 2020 This graph is a plot of average movie run time in minutes against years. From this graph we can see a steady increase in run time from 1920 to 2025. Overall runtime has increased by over 30 minutes from 1920 to 2025. The interesting information here is that the expected average movie run time drops by the year of 2020. 5.10 Movie Run Time Minutes From 1920 to 2020 This boxplot shows movie runtime from 1920 to 2020. Although we already saw runtime increased over time from the line graph above, from the box plots we can see the spread of movie runtime also increased overtime. We can see that the median run time for movies in 1920 is around 70 minutes, and the median run time for movies in 2020 has increased to approximately 90 minutes with maximum run time close to 150 minutes (2.5hours). 5.11 Number of Movies Released By Country In this choropleth graph we plotted the total number of films released in each country from 1920 to 2020. It is visible from the graph that Canada, United States of America, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Western European countries, Russia, India, and Australia have the most film releases overall. Although not very visible from graph, India is the country with the most films released in the world.

Although the age gap of lead actors and actresses has gotten smaller since the 1920s, the median age difference is still over 10 years. From the 2017 salary data we can also see that the top-rated actor made almost 40 million dollars more than the top-rated actress. We also found drama and documentary are the most common movie genres from 1920 to 2020 by more than double of that of the third most common genre (comedy). Although our overall goal for this project was met, it did have shortcomings. Salary data for the movie industry was not publicly available without a paid subscription so we were not able to access more than one years worth of salary information for the top paid actors/actresses. If given more time and resources, we would have liked to further explore the gender pay gap overtime. "]]
